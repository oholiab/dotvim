My .vim crap mainly aimed at automagical syntax checking of puppet and general
ruby mangling.

Dependencies
------------
If you're using default Snow Leopard vim, you'll need to compile for at least
+signs... Personally I just compiled with --with-features=huge for support
for +kitchensink.

Other than that, look at what's in the bundle directory - these are git
submodules which you can clone down automagically if you know how to use git
submodule. They are all vim plugins :)
